# Tado app for Homey

Unofficial Tado thermostat app for <a href="http://www.athom.nl">Homey</a>.

NOTE: This app was taken over by Athom on request of the developer. Only a small fix was made to enable users to authenticate with the Tado API again. This app might not function as expected since it uses the unofficial Tado API.

## Configuration

Go to the Homey settings for Tado, and enter your Tado login and password, this is the same account you use to access https://my.tado.com. This data is only saved locally on your Homey, and not shared with either me or Athom.


## How does it work

The Tado Homey app uses the unofficial my.tado.com API, and does not directly communicate with your Tado device. All data is sent over https, via https://my.tado.com.


## Flow

### Triggers (device)

- The temperature changed (temperature token, in increments of 0.5 °C)
